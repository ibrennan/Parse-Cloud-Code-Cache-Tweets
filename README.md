## To get this script working

You'll need to modify this line to be the Twitter username you want to use:

var screenName = "nannerb";
```
And modify these lines to include your Twitter API keys:
```
var consumerSecret = "";
var tokenSecret = "";
var oauth_consumer_key = "";
var oauth_token = "";
```
